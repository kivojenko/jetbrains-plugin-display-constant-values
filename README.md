# Display Constant Values Plugin  

A lightweight and intuitive IntelliJ IDEA plugin designed to enhance the readability of Python code by folding constants in a clear and meaningful way.  

## Key Features  

- **Enumerated constants** are folded to their **names** for clarity.  
- **Uppercase constants** (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`) are folded to their **values**.  

## How It Works  

This plugin folds constants in the following ways:  

1. **Enumerated Constants**  
  ```python  
  class Color(Enum):  
    RED = 1  
    GREEN = 2  
    BLUE = 3  

  # Color.RED -> RED
  ```  

2. **Uppercase Constants**  
  ```python
  MY_CONSTANT = 42  

  # MY_CONSTANT -> 42
  ```  

## Installation  

You can install this plugin directly from the **IntelliJ Plugin Marketplace**:

2. Go to `File > Settings > Plugins`.  
3. Search for **"Display Constant Values"** in the Marketplace tab.  
4. Click **Install** and restart IDE.
